# Claude Bootstrap

A ready-to-use project template for building web applications with the help of AI.

## Why Use This Project?

This project is designed to make building software easier, especially if you're new to programming or working with AI assistants like Claude.

### No External Services Required

Everything runs on your computer. You don't need to set up databases, cloud accounts, or pay for external services to get started. Just download, install, and run.

### Built-in Guardrails

The project includes automatic checks that help prevent common mistakes:

- **Type checking** catches errors before you run your code
- **Code formatting** keeps everything consistent and readable
- **Linting** warns you about potential problems
- **Commit checks** ensure your saved changes follow best practices

These guardrails mean that even if you're learning, the tools will guide you toward writing better code.

## Required Skills

Before getting started, you should be comfortable with these basics. If any feel unfamiliar, the linked resources will help you brush up.

- **Using the Terminal** - You'll need to type commands to install tools and run the project. No advanced skills required, just the basics of opening Terminal, typing commands, and navigating folders.
  - [Terminal Basics for Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) - Apple's official guide
  - [Command Line Crash Course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Environment_setup/Command_line) - MDN's beginner-friendly introduction

- **Basic File Navigation** - Understanding how folders work on your computer and how to find files. Commands like `cd` (change directory) and `ls` (list files) are helpful to know.
  - [Navigating Files and Directories](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir.html) - Software Carpentry tutorial

- **Text Editing** - You'll be reading and occasionally editing code files. Any text editor works, but [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is popular and free.
  - [VS Code Getting Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) - Video tutorials for beginners

- **Basic Git Concepts** (optional but helpful) - Git saves versions of your code. Claude can handle most Git operations for you, but understanding commits and branches helps.
  - [Git Handbook](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git) - GitHub's concise overview
  - [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Interactive visual tutorial

Don't worry if you're not an expert in these areas. Claude Code can guide you through most tasks, and you'll learn as you go.

## Setting Up Your Mac

Before you can use this project, you'll need a few tools installed on your Mac.

### Step 1: Install Xcode Command Line Tools

These are basic development tools that many other tools depend on. Open the **Terminal** app (search for "Terminal" in Spotlight) and paste this command:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

A popup will appear asking you to install. Click "Install" and wait for it to finish.

### Step 2: Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a tool that makes it easy to install software on your Mac. Paste this command in Terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the instructions on screen. After it finishes, it will tell you to run a few commands to add Homebrew to your path - make sure to do that.

Learn more: [Homebrew Website](https://brew.sh/)

### Step 3: Install Node.js

With Homebrew installed, getting Node.js is simple:

```bash
brew install node
```

### Step 4: Install pnpm

pnpm is the package manager this project uses:

```bash
brew install pnpm
```

## Getting the Project

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

"Forking" creates your own copy of this project on GitHub. This is important because it lets you save your changes and push commits to your own repository.

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) (it's free)
2. Go to [github.com/Oliver-Bagin/Claude-Bootstrap](https://github.com/Oliver-Bagin/Claude-Bootstrap)
3. Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner
4. GitHub will create a copy under your account (e.g., `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Claude-Bootstrap`)

Learn more: [GitHub's Guide to Forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

"Cloning" downloads your forked copy to your computer so you can work on it.

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to where you want the project. For example, to put it in a "Projects" folder in your Documents:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents
   mkdir Projects
   cd Projects
   ```
3. Clone **your fork** (replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Claude-Bootstrap.git
   ```
4. Move into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Claude-Bootstrap
   ```

Now you have your own copy that you can modify and push changes to.

## Getting Started with Claude

Claude Code is an AI assistant that can help you build and modify this project by understanding your instructions in plain English.

### Install Claude Code

1. First, make sure you have Homebrew installed (see above)
2. Install Claude Code via Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install claude-code
   ```
3. You'll need an Anthropic API key. Get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)

Learn more: [Claude Code Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)

### Optional: Install iTerm2

iTerm2 is a better terminal app for Mac with more features than the built-in Terminal. It's not required, but many developers prefer it.

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```

After installing, you can find iTerm in your Applications folder.

Learn more: [iTerm2 Website](https://iterm2.com/)

### Optional: Install Oh My Zsh

Oh My Zsh adds autocompletion, syntax highlighting, and useful plugins to your terminal. It makes working in the terminal easier with features like tab-completing commands, git shortcuts, and more.

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

After installing, restart your terminal. You'll notice a new look and can start using features like:
- **Tab autocompletion** - Press `Tab` to autocomplete commands, file paths, and git branches
- **Git aliases** - Type `gst` instead of `git status`, `gco` instead of `git checkout`, and more
